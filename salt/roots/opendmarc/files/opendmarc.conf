##  FailureReportsSentBy string
##  	default "USER@HOSTNAME"
##
##  Specifies the email address to use in the From: field of failure
##  reports generated by the filter.  The default is to use the userid of
##  the user running the filter and the local hostname to construct an
##  email address.  "postmaster" is used in place of the userid if a name
##  could not be determined.
#
FailureReportsSentBy postmaster@{{domain}}

##  IgnoreHosts path
##  	default (internal)
##
##  Specifies the path to a file that contains a list of hostnames, IP
##  addresses, and/or CIDR expressions identifying hosts whose SMTP
##  connections are to be ignored by the filter.  If not specified, defaults
##  to "127.0.0.1" only.
#
IgnoreHosts /etc/opendmarc/ignore.hosts

PidFile /var/run/opendmarc.pid

##  Socket socketspec
##  	default (none)
##
##  Specifies the socket that should be established by the filter to receive
##  connections from sendmail(8) in order to provide service.  socketspec is
##  in one of two forms: local:path, which creates a UNIX domain socket at
##  the specified path, or inet:port[@host] or inet6:port[@host] which creates
##  a TCP socket on the specified port for the appropriate protocol family.
##  If the host is not given as either a hostname or an IP address, the
##  socket will be listening on all interfaces.  This option is mandatory
##  either in the configuration file or on the command line.  If an IP
##  address is used, it must be enclosed in square brackets.
#
Socket inet6:10028@[::1]

##  Syslog { true | false }
##  	default "false"
##
##  Log via calls to syslog(3) any interesting activity.
#
Syslog true

##  TrustedAuthservIDs string
##  	default HOSTNAME
##
##  Specifies one or more "authserv-id" values to trust as relaying true
##  upstream DKIM and SPF results.  The default is to use the name of
##  the MTA processing the message.  To specify a list, separate each entry
##  with a comma.  The key word "HOSTNAME" will be replaced by the name of
##  the host running the filter as reported by the gethostname(3) function.
#
TrustedAuthservIDs {{fqdn}},{{domain}}

##  UMask mask
##  	default (none)
##
##  Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.  This
##  only really applies to creation of the socket when Socket specifies a
##  UNIX domain socket, and to the HistoryFile and PidFile (if any); temporary
##  files are normally created by the mkstemp(3) function that enforces a
##  specific file mode on creation regardless of the process umask.  See
##  umask(2) for more information.
#
UMask 0002

##  UserID user[:group]
##  	default (none)
##
##  Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.
##  The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of
##  the named userid unless an alternate group is specified.
#
UserID opendmarc:opendmarc
